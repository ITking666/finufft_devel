finufft development directory:

This directory contains (mostly undocumented) codes used to develop
the library. Most of them relate to optimization of various spreading
kernel functions. It also includes the CMAES matlab codes from
https://www.lri.fr/~hansen/cmaes_inmatlab.html

Run at your own risk.
